0. introduction
-----------------
pongian is an free ping pong clone for linux and since v0.3pre-1 also for
windows. it uses sdl to handle video stuff and keyboard events, sdl-image to
view pictures and SFont to display fonts (for information about sdl(-image)
visit http://www.libsdl.org/, for information about SFont visit
http://www.linux-games.com/). pongian is distributed under the
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL).


1. controls
-------------
you can choose your controls via the control menue. by default player 1 controls
through the cursor buttons and player 2 through w, a, s and d. you can also use
your mouse or your joystick (experimental, i've never tested it myself).

3. known issues
-----------------
- pongian has some memory bugs and due to them, it eats memory...
  9 memory errors appear and 22082 bytes are eaten. (all-time-bug)
- sometimes the abrs (advanced ball reflection system) does not really good work 
  (reproduceable?) (2004-06-26)


4. faq
--------
q: what do i need to run pongian?

a: a working linux system with X, sdl 1.2.x and sdl_image. i think thats all.


q: i want to play pongian using joystick, what do i have to do?

a: just connect your joystick and start pongian. if you can select 'joystick' in
   the control menue, the joystick works. 
   if you can't select it in the control menue, then something went wrong
   (*suprise*). start pongian with the '-l1' switch and then take a look at the
   pongian.log file. if it does NOT contain "(==) pongian: joystick support
   enabled." then it is not pongian's fault.
   check if your joystick works with another application. if yes, then ???.


q: how do i create themes?

a: i think the best is to take a look at the default theme (specially the
   theme.conf!).
   note: - you must use 640x480 images for background images
		 - you must use images that are handled by sdl-image (eg png and jpeg)
		 - too high quality images can slow-down pongian

    
q: for which platform(s) is pongian available?

a: for linux and windows, if you want to test another platform just compile the 
   source. let me know if you run pongian on other systems than linux or
   windows.

    
q: i've found a bug in pongian, what should i do?

a: first of all, if it is a bug, can you reproduce it? 
   -> yes? then write to software@steffmeister.at, subject "pongian", write what
   you do to reproduce the bug.
   -> no? then don't even think about to write me.
   if you found a bug in the documentation (missspels, senseless sentences, ... 
   my english is not perfect) also write to software@steffmeister.at, 
   subject "pongian", write the line(s) which contain(s) the bug(s) (maybe also
   the line number?).
   NOTE: if you've found a bug in a theme, don't write to me if i am not the
   author!!
    

5. optional information
-------------------------
start pongian with '--help' to see some command-line options.
if pongian acts funny, start pongian with '-l1' (-> "pongian.log") or '-l2'
(-> console) to activate logging.

if you want to know more about pongian, like it or even when you hate it then
write to steffed@gmx.net with subject "pongian".
